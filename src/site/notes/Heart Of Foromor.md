(This was written as the plot to a Minecraft server with the origins mod, something the players would find on a discord chat named #LoreBackground or something of the sort.)

The [[Hermeticore/Lands/Foromor Empire\|Foromor Empire]] is the biggest land of [[Hermeticore/Hermeticore\|Hermeticore]], with the most diverse population out of any other land, having at least a couple people of every [[Hermeticore/Heritages\|Heritage]] living in it, it is home to the best forgers in the world and some of the smartest magicians.

Almost anyone can feel at home in this land, with underground cities and diverse biomes fitting anyone's needs. And abundant [[Hermeticore/Magic/Mana\|Mana]] sources to feed the military and markets around the nation.

You however, find yourself in a not so welcoming part of Foromor, reports have been coming from up north of a great beast ravaging the lands, many even say it is one of [[Hermeticore/Maragor\|Maragor]]'s children. 

The reports include that the destruction was so immense that the lands looked barren after the beast attacked, only a few villages surviving here and there, many great mages have been sent to create a barrier around what they believe is the location of this beast. You are inside of this barrier.

Either you took up the bounty from a King or from Emperor Foromor himself to slay the beast, or you are someone from one of those villages, or you are simply an adventurer that somehow found yourself wandering into this place before the barrier was put in place.

What matters is that you are inside the barrier and can't seem to leave it, who you are and what you do is up to you! What do you say? Are you ready for this adventure?
