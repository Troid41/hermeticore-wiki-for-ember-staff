The Nether, as the [[Hermeticore/Lands/Bishopric Of Dykourza\|Bishopric Of Dykourza]] calls it. Is a dimension feared by many, being regarded as hell itself.

It was first discovered by [[Hermeticore/Proteo\|Proteo]], a [[Hermeticore/Species/Dragonborns\|Dragonborn]] magician that was once part of the [[Hermeticore/Lands/Patriarchate of Rosanova\|Patriarchate of Rosanova]]. It served as a great tool to create the Bishopric of Dykourza, with Proteo's son, Tariq, as the ruler.

This plane is home to many sentient species similar to the Heritages on Hermeticore, [[Hermeticore/Species/Demons\|Demons]], [[Hermeticore/Species/Phantoms\|Phantoms]], among others. It is also a place filled with treacherous creatures.
It is also home to [[Hermeticore/Maragor\|Maragor]], the ruler of this plane.

There are theories that when someone teleports they pass through this plane before coming out to their destination.
