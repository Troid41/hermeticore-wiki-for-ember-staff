The Kingdom of Kradsun once had the second largest population of dwarves.
The Kingdom consisted mostly of Humans and Orcs, and Dwarves.
Kradsun was a country that focused mostly on physical military power and the power of mana Crystals. This was due to the low inherent mana of the general populous. 

That was until, a town of Dwarves found out about a nearby volcano near the coast of Kradsun, and they wanted to keep it for themselves.
After a couple years that one town had spread word to other Dwarves around Kradsun about plans of creating their own country, and so, they all concentrated on the coast, forming [[Hermeticore/Lands/Masehk\|Masehk]], a plot of land aiming to be free of Kradsun's command.

They finally achieved that freedom by utilizing the mana of the volcano nearby and secured their land after many battles. They are constantly at war with Kradsun, but often overpowering them and being able to maintain their land with their reservoirs of mana.
