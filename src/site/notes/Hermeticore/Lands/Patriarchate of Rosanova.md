The Patriarchate of Rosanova is a highly religious land that worships [[Hermeticore/Ethos\|Ethos]].

It is the strongest nation on Hermeticore with their volcano islands and mana seep discoveries, even after the [[Hermeticore/Lands/Bishopric Of Dykourza\|Bishopric Of Dykourza]] took part of it's land and two of its volcanoes, Rosanova still stands as the richest in mana.
