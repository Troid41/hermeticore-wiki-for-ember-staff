Masehk is a land of mostly Dwarves, at constant war with Kradsun due to how their nation was formed.

Masehk used to be part of Kradsun, until a town of [[Hermeticore/Species/Dwarves\|Dwarves]] discovered a nearby volcano flowing with pure mana. They then organized a war to claim the land they now call Masehk.

They now keep a tight formation around their borders with the help of their mana reservoirs, in constant conflict with [[Hermeticore/Lands/Kingdom of Kradsun\|Kradsun]], often being shunned by even other Dwarves of Kradsun that consider Masehk citizens as traitors and untrustworthy people.
