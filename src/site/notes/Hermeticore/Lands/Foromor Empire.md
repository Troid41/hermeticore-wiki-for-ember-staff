Biggest land in [[Hermeticore/Hermeticore\|Hermeticore]], its people are very proud of the fact they have the two of the biggest sources of flowing lava in the world. The two volcanoes are not active for hundreds of years but the energy emanating from them is used very efficiently by the empire for their military and farming needs.

The land also has two secret underground cities, located near each volcano, strategically placed to mine ores and crystals that have a high concentration of [[Hermeticore/Magic/Mana\|Mana]] in them. Since extracting the liquid mana from volcanoes is very risky and not very practical to use as crystals that you can place on the tip of staffs, or amulets to focus your spells through.

The main enemy of Foromor is the [[Hermeticore/Lands/Kingdom of Hoppla\|Kingdom of Hoppla]], which long ago owned one of the two volcanoes of Foromor. Hoppla was outsmarted by the dwarfs of Foromor due to their crystal mines, being both almost as potent as liquid mana but also much more versatile in battle.

After that they took the [[Hermeticore/Lands/Protectorate of Storkin\|Protectorate of Storkin]] under their protection with the agreement that they wouldn't do business with Hoppla, to ensure they are cut off from any external liquid mana supplies.
