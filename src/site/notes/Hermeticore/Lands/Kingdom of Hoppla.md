Outsmarted by Foromor in war
Lost one volcano
betrayed by Storkin

The Kingdom of Hoppla was once one of the strongest nations due to the access they had to three volcanoes they under their territory. 

But that soon changed once the [[Hermeticore/Lands/Foromor Empire\|Foromor Empire]] schemed to cause conflict between Hoppla, starting a war against them whilst simultaneously causing a civil war to break on the Kingdom.

This caused Hoppla to divide itself, and Foromor promised to keep the [[Hermeticore/Lands/Protectorate of Storkin\|Protectorate of Storkin]], the now new nation formed from the civil war, safe from Hoppla. As long as they helped them to conquer the volcano nearest to their border, taking even more territory from Hoppla.

Now Hoppla is under constant attacks from both nations, but is able to barely survive due to their mana seeps on the shore and their volcano, coupled with their very effective military.
