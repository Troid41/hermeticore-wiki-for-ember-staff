The Bishopric of Dykourza was founded by [[Hermeticore/Proteo\|Proteo]] following the guidance of a follower of [[Hermeticore/Maragor\|Maragor]]. It is a highly religious nation which seeks to expand their territory by brute force and by infiltrating other nations, they believe that once the entirety of [[Hermeticore/Hermeticore\|Hermeticore]] is populated by [[Hermeticore/Species/Demons\|Demons]] and [[Hermeticore/Species/Tieflings\|Tieflings]] that the world will be "saved" and blessed by being visited by Maragor herself.

This nation also houses the only portal to another place outside the [[Hermeticore/Material Plane\|Material Plane]], [[Hermeticore/The Nether\|The Nether]], house of Maragor and its children.

It is currently represented by [[Hermeticore/Tariq\|Tariq]], son of Proteo, but in reality it is ruled by Maragor giving orders to Tariq through his Demons.
