At the start of Hermeticore's lifespan, [[Hermeticore/Pathos\|Pathos]] made humans all equal, but due to the [[Hermeticore/Magic/Planet core\|Planet core]] being pure mana, volatile and ever changing, it corrupted any living beings exposed to it for too long.

This created different heritages for humans.

How some heritages formed heavily depends on where they are, being near cold areas with lots of mana, could quickly mutate them to adapt to it. That'd apply for people living near the sea, hot lands, so on so forth. There's a multitude of parameters that could have created each Heritage.

Some heritages have even been created through curses from outer gods, just to give an example as to what "multitude of parameters" can mean.
