Proteo was a skilled Dragonborn magician who dedicated his life in finding ways to transport items or people with mana.

While trying to teleport himself from one city to another, in a risky attempt to discover something new, he somehow made contact with beings from another dimension between the teleportation. He was the first person to ever successfully teleport in history.

But in order to teleport, he unknowingly, very briefly passed through another dimension, which he would go on to name "[[Hermeticore/The Nether\|The Nether]]". His theory was that 1 meter in that dimension was a much longer distance in their plane.

What he heard in those brief moments while teleporting were screams of terror, sometimes whispers, sometimes the cracking of fire.

But ever since his first contact with the dimension, he heard voices, [[Hermeticore/Maragor\|Maragor]], the ruler of that plane was trying to give him orders, plans. Plans to build a bridge between the two planes.

Proteo being very intelligent and considered a genius at his time, spent months trying to translate the whispers, slowly learning the common language of the nether. When he finally was able to understand it, he noticed he was not speaking in normal sentences, he was giving him parameter, numbers, materials.

He was giving him the ritual to open a portal to another dimension.
Proteo was highly influential at the time, and he used that to create a cult, dedicated to worshipping the deity providing him with this "forbidden knowledge" of outside dimensions. He gathered esoteric renowned scholars to his secret group and built an altar under his manor, following the steps Maragor gave him.

It took a great deal of mana and ritualistic sacrifices to complete the steps provided but it worked, he'd opened a portal to The Nether. Upon the opening of it, he was greeted by a tall creature with hooves for feet, skin as red as Proteo's scales and sharp claws. They called themselves [[Hermeticore/Species/Demons\|Demons]], a spawn created from a mortal and a god.

He was guided by a demon serving as a prophet of Maragor, who promised to guide Proteo and his people to greatness, and that the entirety of Hermeticore would be his if he swore his life and his lineages life to Maragor.

Proteo accepted the offer, going on to form an army of magicians and demons to take part of [[Hermeticore/Lands/Patriarchate of Rosanova\|Rosanova's Patriarchate]]. Creating the [[Hermeticore/Lands/Bishopric Of Dykourza\|Bishopric Of Dykourza]], which he led, following the advice of Maragor's prophet, a demon who refused to name himself anything other than that.

Once he died his rule was passed onto his son [[Hermeticore/Tariq\|Tariq]], a [[Hermeticore/Species/Tieflings\|Tiefling]] made from an affair Proteo had with a demon working at his castle.
