Dragonborns mutated to have scales instead of skin, scales that protect them against fire and heat, allowing them to live on very hot locations.

Dragonborns also grew tails, ranging from short ones to long ones reaching a meter long, they lost their ears instead just having holes and grew a face that looks more like dragons, hence the name. Having sharp teeth and snouts.

A select few Dragonborn can even create fire from their mouths.

They are also one of the most powerful sentient creatures mana-wise. But they near the limit of "mutation" humans can get, some being born not being able to speak or understand anyone, being treated like less than people for their lack of "consciousness" and more like animals.

Dragonborns live an average of 300 years.

Their inherent mana is equivalent to two drops of pure mana.
