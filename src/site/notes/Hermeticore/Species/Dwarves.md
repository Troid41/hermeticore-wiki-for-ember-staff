Dwarves mutated to see better in the dark, and have a more sensitive vision, preferring to be in dark places. They live half as long as Humans, living up to 250 years.

The biggest population of Dwarves is located on the [[Hermeticore/Lands/Foromor Empire\|Foromor Empire]], with two more small societies on [[Hermeticore/Lands/Kingdom of Kradsun\|Kradsun]] and [[Hermeticore/Lands/Masehk\|Masehk]].

In all of those locations dwarves often opt to work in the mines due to their affinity for the dark and somewhat increased strength and muscle mass compared to other Heritages. Of course not all of them do so, others being historians, forgers, and anything else they'd want to be, they have free will after all.

Their inherent mana is equivalent to half a drop of pure mana.
