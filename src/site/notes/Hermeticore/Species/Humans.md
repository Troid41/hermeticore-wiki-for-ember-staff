Humans are the oldest species of Hermeticore, but also the weakest one when it comes to mana, the only remaining humans are ones who for some unknown reason are unable to absorb mana, being born without it.

They also have one of the longest life spans together with [[Hermeticore/Species/Elves\|Elves]] and [[Hermeticore/Species/Dragonborns\|Dragonborns]], living up to 400 years.

Many speculate that Elves and Dragonborns have a long lifespan due to mana mutation, but that all other species *don't* have a long life span due to mana mutation. Meaning Humans always had long lives before they started changing and separating themselves into different Heritages.
