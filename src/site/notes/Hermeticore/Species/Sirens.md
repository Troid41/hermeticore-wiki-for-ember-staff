Humans cursed by [[Hermeticore/Carmarat\|Carmarat]], a minor deity created in [[Hermeticore/Hermeticore\|Hermeticore]].

Sirens are cursed to only eat the flesh of [[Hermeticore/Heritages\|Heritages]] deriving from [[Hermeticore/Species/Humans\|Humans]], being forced to find ways to attract sailors to them, hunting anyone they can reach from the water.

They need to stay underwater in order to breathe and have half their body be that of an octopus.
They live only 50 years. And have the inherent mana equivalent of 2 drops of pure mana.
