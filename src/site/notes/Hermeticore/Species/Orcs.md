Orcs are the strongest [[Hermeticore/Heritages\|Heritages]] physically but also the one who can use the least magic due to their inherent [[Hermeticore/Magic/Mana\|mana]] of only a third of a mana drop.

Orcs live up to 200 years.

They only apparent mutations from humans are their increased muscle mass, greenish skin and an overall bigger frame, being as tall as elves.

They generally have a very asocial culture, mostly having closed off territories.

The largest amount of Orcs living outside their closed off spaces can be found in the [[Hermeticore/Lands/Foromor Empire\|Foromor Empire]], some Orcs even leave their home towns to work as bodyguards, or on the military for other kingdoms.
