Elves have almost no difference from humans, being taller, having pointy ears and sharper senses, and of course, inherent [[Hermeticore/Magic/Mana\|mana]]. They live as long as [[Hermeticore/Species/Humans\|Humans]] and seem to connect to nature better than other Heritages, be it above or below ground fauna and flora.

The amount of inherent mana they have is equivalent to one and a half drops of pure mana, meaning they can cast quite powerful spells without getting tired for an hour and a half straight.

Elves live up to 400 years.
