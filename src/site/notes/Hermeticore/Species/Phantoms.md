Souls cursed by [[Hermeticore/Maragor\|Maragor]] to serve as spies for him.

A punishment often given to people who broke a deal and did not deliver, they have their soul taken by Maragor and their body becomes a husk of what it once was, being now transparent and intangible, and also losing their free will.

Since they have no soul, they can only be dispelled back to [[Hermeticore/The Nether\|The Nether]], where their other half is stored.
Phantoms live almost as long as Maragor wants them to, with the oldest ones being 134 thousand years old.
