Tieflings are the result of any mortal having a child with a [[Hermeticore/Species/Demons\|demon]].

Tieflings often are higher than their mortal parent's heritage, since demons are very tall creatures. They also gain some resistance to heat if they already did not have it from their mortal counterpart, coupled with Darkvision allowing them to see well in dimly lit areas.

Tieflings live a third less long than their mortal counterpart.
Tieflings have an extra drop of mana added to their inherent mana on top of the base inherent mana from their mortal heritage.

The biggest population of Tieflings comes from the [[Hermeticore/Lands/Bishopric Of Dykourza\|Bishopric Of Dykourza]], while other Tieflings are spread around [[Hermeticore/Hermeticore\|Hermeticore]], those who managed to escape their homeland. The most common place for escapees of Dykourza is the [[Hermeticore/Lands/Foromor Empire\|Foromor Empire]], due to how accepting and busy it is, with much Heritage diversity in it.
