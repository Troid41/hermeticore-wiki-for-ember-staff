Children of [[Hermeticore/Maragor\|Maragor]] with mortals from various other planets or planes of existence.

Most demons come exclusively from great warriors handpicked by Maragor herself based on their strength and mana capacity. Most mortals die from either giving birth to a demon or on the process itself (Not getting any more detailed here folks).

Demons have a base of 6 drops of mana plus the inherent mana from their mortal counterpart added onto that.

Demons live up to 1.200 years independently of their mortal counterpart and are at least 9 feet tall, unless their mortal parent was taller than that.
