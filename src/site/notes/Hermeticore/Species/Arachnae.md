Arachnae are the most corrupted [[Hermeticore/Heritages\|Heritage]] on [[Hermeticore/Hermeticore\|Hermeticore]], having passed what many consider "the limit" of mutation, giving them their very distinct appearance. Many Arachnae are born without a proper consciousness, acting purely on instinct, and most parents kill those offsprings due to that fact, often a third of every Arachnae batch needs to be culled, even after that fact they are still the heritage with the biggest birth rate!

They come from a long lineage of [[Hermeticore/Species/Humans\|Humans]] living underground, which made them evolve so see better in the dark and have more sensitive vision than even Dwarves!

They also mutated to have more eyes to let them see underground creatures approaching more easily. The extra arms have no obvious purpose other than more versatility, most just say it's the corruption randomness rather than an evolution step.

Arachnae also have different mouths which make it more difficult to communicate with people outside their Heritage, due to how low they speak and the constant rattling they emit when doing so.

Due to how mutated they have become by mana exposure, they have the inherent mana of 2 and a half drops of mana.

Many call the fact that they can still hold a consciousness a miracle while many others have prejudice against them with the belief they are bad actors pretending to be peaceful.

Their similarities with arachnids are many, from how they birth their offspring to how they eat, usually preferring raw meats from wild beasts to other insects, many other Heritages find their diet repulsive.
