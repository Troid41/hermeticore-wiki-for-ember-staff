Carmarat is a good example as to why no one should look to immerse themselves in mana, not just because it'd kill you and potentially melt you, but because of the changes it'd bring you.

Carmarat was once a rare creature, a giant sentient octopus that guarded a mana seep near the Kingdom of Pedrizia. 

[[Hermeticore/Species/Orcs\|Orc]] fishermen from the coast of Pedrizia caught wind of the mana seep as it was near a volcano where many giant crab and fish were found due to the mana corruption from the volcano.

Once they tried to get close to the seep, they were attacked and killed by Carmarat, and that only attracted more ships to the location to investigate their disappearance. Battleships, Carmarat was killed, but she brought down two of the ships with her. She fell to the ocean floor next to the seep with a dead Dragonborn above her, his spear still lodged in her flesh, his hand still around the weapon's shaft even after death.

Months later, the energy exuding from the reservoir of mana awakened Carmarat. As she looked around she noticed her body wasn't the same, she had hands, but her lower body was still her old octopus body, she had become an amalgam. Her tentacles forever scarred have now healed with the arrows and weapons still inside them, some even had people's limbs attached to them, she had become a true monster, exactly what her hunters were calling her before.

She quickly swam to the volcano island's shore near the seep, and looked at her reflection in the water, she felt scared by what she saw, a half dead half alive dragonborn still wearing a rusting plated armor set. Her new "face" being only half of one, with the other half being bare bones and muscle. She tried to speak, and a raspy deep voice came from inside her. Her fear turned to sadness, her sadness to anger, her anger to hatred. She swore to enact revenge.

And that she did, after 40 years, she had learned how powerful she was, not only because she had been born near a mana seep, but because of the Dragonborn body she possessed above her body she could cast powerful spells.

She decided to curse the entire coast of Pedrizia utilizing the mana from the mana seep she was born near. She redirected all incoming mana to she shores of Pedrizia with a powerful spell that originally gave people the ability to breathe underwater for a certain amount of time depending on their mana. But because of the excessive amount of pure liquid mana flowing on the shores, the effect was much less predictable, infecting anyone submerged in those waters and turning them into some sort of half octopus half human creature, into what is now known as [[Hermeticore/Species/Sirens\|Sirens]].

Due to the feat Carmarat pulled that day, she is considered by many scholars as a minor deity, being able to change people's physique, cursing them to be just like her, to suffer the same fate she did.
