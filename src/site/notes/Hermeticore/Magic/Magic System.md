In Hermeticore people utilize [[Hermeticore/Magic/Mana\|Mana]] to cast their spells, anyone can create a "new" spell by how they handle their mana, making this system very technical. Casters need to think in very specific terms, where they want their mana to go, how fast, how much mana they want to output, so on so forth.

With enough knowledge one can teleport, fly, move massive objects around with just the movement of their hands, given they have the mana to support their spells of course.

Most [[Hermeticore/Heritages\|Heritages]] have inherent mana, letting them cast spells that don't require much mana. The amount of mana one has depends on multiple different parameters, but mostly on their ancestors and their place of origin. Some nobles and rich people choose to specifically live and raise their children near volcanoes or store mana crystals on their furniture, clothing and sometimes even on their heads. All in hopes that their body absorbs that mana even if slowly. 

------------------------------------
Apart from inherent mana, one can also use liquid, or solid mana to cast their spells.

- Liquid mana comes directly from the [[Hermeticore/Magic/Planet core\|Planet core]], and is very hard to handle, being extremely hot and requiring specialized canisters to carry it around. You can find small vials of it being sold on more wealthy nations, but its price is quite steep not only because of how much power liquid mana possesses but also due to how hard it is to create the vials themselves.

	There also exists vials of unconcentrated mana for oral consumption, which are a brew of plants and digestible things that contain high concentrations of mana, these are commonly used to replenish the inherent mana many have.

- Solid mana ranges from crystals to wood from trees grown very close to mana reservoirs.

	 - [[Hermeticore/Magic/Mana Crystals\|Mana Crystals]] are just that, highly concentrated crystals containing huge amounts of mana, these crystals usually glow a bright orange light that dims and loses it's color when the object starts running out of mana, which can be prevented if the owner transfers its mana inside of it, slowly replenishing it, or uses liquid mana to "refill" it.
	   These crystals are often used on amulets, staffs, wands and all sorts of things.
  
		There are also "fake" mana crystals, which are simply normal crystals that have been exposed to mana reservoirs for very long periods of time, sometimes thousands of years, that also have a big amount of mana. The reason they are considered fake is that no one is able to insert mana into it like normal mana crystals.
	
	- Plants are also used as secondary sources of magic, usually wood that grows near mana reservoirs is used only for wands, staffs and such.
