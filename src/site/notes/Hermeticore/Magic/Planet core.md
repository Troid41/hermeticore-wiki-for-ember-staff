[[Hermeticore/Pathos\|Pathos]] when creating Hermeticore wanted to experiment by making the core of the planet be pure [[Hermeticore/Magic/Mana\|Mana]], pure magic, energy that flows through any orifice it may find so it can seep to the surface.

In his quest to make the "perfect world" he allowed himself to experiment and fail many times when creating worlds, many times making ones on a whim to test theories he had, much to the dismay of whatever living being was born on those planets. [[Hermeticore/Hermeticore\|Hermeticore]] being a good example of that.

Hermeticore's core is overflowing with mana, its center infinitely generates mana that then flows outwards and is absorbed by the living beings of the planet.

The reason this is dangerous, is that many of the "monsters" of this planet are simply heavily corrupted humans. [[Hermeticore/Heritages\|Heritages]] are just the more "stable" mutations that mana caused on them. Pathos in his quest to make an immortal world, foresaw this, and did nothing to stop such aggravated forms of mutations from happening because he thought it'd unite Hermeticore's people and push them to evolve.
