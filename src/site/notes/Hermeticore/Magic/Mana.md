Each heritage utilizes the planet's mana in different ways, some use it's pure form by harvesting the mana coming from active volcanoes or from things akin to oil rigs but with mana instead of oil. Or by being near [[Hermeticore/Magic/Divergent Boundaries\|Divergent Boundaries]].

Other use [[Hermeticore/Magic/Mana Crystals\|Mana Crystals]] from deep underground, that have been imbued with mana, by simply being near reservoirs of it for long periods of time. Or using plants from near volcanic areas, harvesting beasts from deep in the ocean who grew near natural seeps of mana (much like real life with natural seeps of oil), among other techniques.

A lot of creatures and [[Hermeticore/Heritages\|heritages]] have inherent mana, simply by having evolved on a world exuding so much mana from underground, some more than others, and very few being immune to mana absorption, not being able to use mana unless they own a crystal or liquid mana.

Any creature with inherent mana is also born with a limit to how much mana they can have, being a very hard thing to increase. They can replenish their mana by many ways considering almost everything in the world has some sort of inherent mana within it.

So eating, drinking, just... Living can slowly replenish their inherent mana.
