Many societies who don't have access to liquid forms of mana, or vegetation fed by reservoirs of mana, opt to dig deep underground in hopes to find crystals imbued with mana.

A good example of societies focusing on mining crystals is the [[Hermeticore/Lands/Foromor Empire\|Foromor Empire]], the [[Hermeticore/Lands/Kingdom of Kradsun\|Kingdom of Kradsun]], among other smaller locations.
