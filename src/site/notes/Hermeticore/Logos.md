Logos is the most powerful deity on the [[Hermeticore/Material Plane\|Material Plane]].

Father to [[Hermeticore/Ethos\|Ethos]] and [[Hermeticore/Pathos\|Pathos]]. He's the one who keeps them in check and orders them to create and supervise all living and non living things in his plane.

He makes sure nothing can get too powerful or out of control, rarely intervening with the business of mortals.
He's also responsible for the safety of the plane, trying to keep it from being consumed by [[Hermeticore/The Void\|The Void]].
