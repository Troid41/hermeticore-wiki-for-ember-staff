God, forger of worlds, creator of [[Hermeticore/Hermeticore\|Hermeticore]].

Pathos is a very distant god, he does not like seeing his creations die, often rather having no followers and letting his creations suffer eternally than being taken by The Void or being destroyed by other forces.

He's the son of [[Hermeticore/Logos\|Logos]], brother of [[Hermeticore/Ethos\|Ethos]].
