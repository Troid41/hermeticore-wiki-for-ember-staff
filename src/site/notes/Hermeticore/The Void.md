Not much is known about the void, it was first discovered when a great magician from the Kingdom of Sproct, while testing out a spell known as "Evoporo", which evaporates a certain area depending on the mana capacity of the person, replacing it with vacuum, causing an implosion after casting. He wanted to find out if the matter being "evaporated" actually went somewhere, and on pure chance, decided to evaporate a bird familiar whilst concentrating on a spell that let him see through the bird's eyes and hear what he heard.

Upon evaporating the bird, he could see... Nothing, it was pure darkness, but somehow he was still linked to the bird, he heard it in agony as it somehow fell on nothing, and after a few seconds the connection was lost. He assumed it was because the bird died, and wrote down his findings.

Years later some people still test his theory on magical schools, getting the same results as him, and the void remains a mysterious dimension to many.
