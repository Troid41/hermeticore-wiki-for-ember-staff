Daughter of [[Hermeticore/Logos\|Logos]], sister of [[Hermeticore/Pathos\|Pathos]].

Ethos is a very sympathetic goddess. She seeks to protect any living being, and represents the collective spirit of all living things.

Many people who worship her give her different names, and follow different rules that she "gave" them.

But Ethos mostly seeks to bless people who pray to her and aid in any way she can to stop conflict and help people persevere through hardships. She never asks for anything in return other than that they stay alive and in harmony with one another in her name, whatever that name may be.
