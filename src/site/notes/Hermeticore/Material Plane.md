The main plane of existence. Interconnected with many others.

It used to be a chaotic dimension of pure energy. Somehow, somewhere, this energy aligned perfectly bringing a being to life, [[Hermeticore/Logos\|Logos]].

As soon as this one being was created, something that was not two things at the same time, something not as volatile as the ever changing matter floating about on the Material plane, everything else started to take form as well.

Little is known about the early eons of the Material plane, other than that Logos created two companions for himself, two children, [[Hermeticore/Ethos\|Ethos]] and [[Hermeticore/Pathos\|Pathos]].
